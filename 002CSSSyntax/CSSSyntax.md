# CSS Syntax

- a CSS `rule` consists of a `selector` and a `declaration block`
```css
h1 {
    color:blue;
    font-size:12px;
}

```


| Selector | Declaration block |
|---|---|
| h1 | {color:blue; font-size:12px}|

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| color: | blue|
| font-size: | 12px|

- the `selector` points to the HTML element you want to style
- the `declaration block` contains one or more declarations separated by commas
- each `declaration` contains a CSS `property name` and `value` separated by a colon
- multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons
- declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces

```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```
